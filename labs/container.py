# Exercise 1
# Create a list named students containing some student names (strings).
# Print out the second student's name.
# Print out the last student's name.

students = ['Sabika', 'Layla', 'Ranya']
print(students[1])
print(students[2])

###########################

# Exercise 2
# Create a tuple named foods containing the same number of foods (strings) as there are names in the students list.
# Use a for loop to print out the string "food goes here is a good food".

foods = ('pizza', 'pasta', 'sushi')
for food in foods:
    print(f"{food} is a good food")

###########################

# Exercise 3
# Using a for loop, print just the last two food strings from foods.

# foods = ('pizza', 'pasta', 'sushi')
for food in foods[-2:]: # gives the last two
    print(f"{food} is a good food")

# Exercise 4
# Create a dictionary named home_town containing the keys of city, state and population.
# Print a string with this format:
# "I was born in city, state - population of population"

home_town = {
    'city': 'Manama',
    'state': 'Bahrain',
    'population': '600,000'
}
print(f"I was born in {home_town['city']}, {home_town['state']} - population of {home_town['population']}")

###########################

# Exercise 5
# Iterate over the key: value pairs in home_town and print a string for each item, for example:
# "city = Arcadia"
# "state = California"
# "population = 58000"

# home_town = {
#     'city': 'Manama',
#     'state': 'Bahrain',
#     'population': '600,000'
# }
for key, value in home_town.items():
    print(f"{key} = {value}")

# Exercise 6
# Create an empty list named cohort.

# Using a for loop, add one dictionary to the cohort list for each student name. Each dictionary should have this shape:

# {
#   'student': 'Tina',
#   'fav_food' 'Cheeseburger'
# }
# Iterate over cohort printing out each element.

cohort = []
for idx, name in enumerate(students):
    cohort.append({
        'name': name,
        'fav_food': foods[idx]
        })

for student in cohort:
    print(student)

###########################

# Exercise 7
# Using the list of students and list comprehension, assign to a variable named awesome_students a new list containing strings similar to this:
# ["Tina is awesome!", "Fred is awesome!", "Wilma is awesome!"]
# Iterate over awesome_students printing out each string.

awesome_students = []
for idx, name in enumerate(students):
    awesome_students.append({
        'name': name
        })

for student in awesome_students:
    print(f"{student['name']} is awesome!")

# another way
# awesome_students = [f"{s['name']} is awesome" for s in cohort]
# for a in awesome_students:
#     print(a)

###########################

# Exercise 8
# Using the tuple foods and list comprehension within a for loop, print each food string that contains the letter a.

for food in foods:
    if 'a' in food:
        print(food)
